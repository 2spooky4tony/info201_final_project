We are interested in this field and domain because of it's rising relevance in the modern world. 
The recent social unrest that came with the pandemic and protests of this year way across all social media platforms.

Question 2:
[Social Media and Mental Health: Benefits, Risks, and Opportunities for Research and Practice](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s41347-020-00134-x#Sec2) 
[The Impact of Social Media on Mental Health](https://scholarworks.lib.csusb.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2131&context=etd)  
[Adolescent social media use and mental health from adolescent and parent perspectives](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0140197117301318) 
[5 ways social media can affect your mental health](https://go-gale-com.offcampus.lib.washington.edu/ps/i.do?p=ITOF&u=wash_main&id=GALE%7CA431216234&v=2.1&it=r)

Question 3:
1.) Is there anything we can infer from data about the relationship between social media and the mental health of individuals? (Are there patterns in the data sets?)
2.) Are there specific age groups, sexual orientation, genders, ... that are at higher risk?
3.) Is there a relationship between lonliness (single vs married, in a relationship, etc) and social media usage?

Question 4:
Data set 1): [The loneliest users on reddit](https://www.kaggle.com/kingburrito666/the-loneliest-users-on-reddit)
This data came from a survey taken on reddit from the r/ForeverAlone subreddit.
Liam Larson (host) collected the data from the survey.
19 columns, 469 rows.
We can answer our second question about the data set, which could infer which groups of people frequent social media platforms more than others.
It also identifies the 'loneliness' of the individuals, as well as their mental health (depressed).
